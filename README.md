# Wall Street Crew
## Financial Analyst Simulation

The Wall Street Crew is a multi-agent simulation system designed to mimic the behavior of financial analysts on Wall Street. This system consists of multiple agents that interact with each other to simulate a financial market environment.

### Agents

* **Financial Analyst**: Analyzes financial data, generates research reports, and provides investment recommendations.
* **Research Analyst**: Focuses on analyzing specific industries or companies, providing in-depth research reports.
* **Investment Banker**: Helps clients raise capital, advise on strategic transactions, and manage financial transactions.

### Features

* **Data Analysis**: Agents collect and analyze financial data from various sources.
* **Report Generation**: Agents generate research reports based on their analysis.
* **Investment Decisions**: Agents make investment decisions based on their research and analysis.

### Purpose

The purpose of this simulation is to provide a flexible framework for simulating complex financial systems. It can be used for various purposes such as:

* **Financial Modeling**: Simulating the behavior of financial markets and testing investment strategies.
* **Research**: Analyzing the behavior of financial analysts and identifying trends or patterns.
* **Education**: Teaching students about financial markets and the role of financial analysts.

## FinancialAnalyst Crew

Welcome to the FinancialAnalyst Crew project, powered by [crewAI](https://crewai.com). This template is designed to help you set up a multi-agent AI system with ease, leveraging the powerful and flexible framework provided by crewAI. Our goal is to enable your agents to collaborate effectively on complex tasks, maximizing their collective intelligence and capabilities.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python >=3.10 <3.14 installed on your system. This project uses [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management and package handling, offering a seamless setup and execution experience.

First, if you haven't already, install uv:

```bash
pip install uv
```

Next, navigate to your project directory and install the dependencies:

(Optional) Lock the dependencies and install them by using the CLI command:
```bash
crewai install
```
### Customizing

**Add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` into the `.env` file**

- Modify `src/financial_analyst/config/agents.yaml` to define your agents
- Modify `src/financial_analyst/config/tasks.yaml` to define your tasks
- Modify `src/financial_analyst/crew.py` to add your own logic, tools and specific args
- Modify `src/financial_analyst/main.py` to add custom inputs for your agents and tasks

## Running the Project

To kickstart your crew of AI agents and begin task execution, run this from the root folder of your project:

```bash
$ crewai run
```

This command initializes the financial_analyst Crew, assembling the agents and assigning them tasks as defined in your configuration.

This example, unmodified, will run the create a `report.md` file with the output of a research on LLMs in the root folder.

## Understanding Your Crew

The financial_analyst Crew is composed of multiple AI agents, each with unique roles, goals, and tools. These agents collaborate on a series of tasks, defined in `config/tasks.yaml`, leveraging their collective skills to achieve complex objectives. The `config/agents.yaml` file outlines the capabilities and configurations of each agent in your crew.
